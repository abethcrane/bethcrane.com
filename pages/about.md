Sometimes I write constantly, sometimes I go months polishing my thoughts in my brain like a rock tumbler. At times I want to share where I'm at, and other times the notes are just for me. All of which is to say, I don't update this on any kind of schedule, and I've made peace with the lack of consistency.

## Some things don't change ##
Barring an apocalypse, no matter how long it's been since I wrote this, you can probably find me:
- reading
- drinking tea
- proclaiming that e-bikes are how god intended man to travel
- at a friend's show
- on a train
- pointing a camera straight up at some backlit leaves
- combing through a vintage store

## Career ##
I get excited about opportunities that:
- work with companies/organizations that positively impact the world
- tackle difficult questions around the role of technology in society
- solve measurable problems for users
- allow me to operate at the edge of my abilities, stretching/growing my skills
- enable me to explore the world and live in different places (e.g. having international offices, enabling remote work for a few months each year)
- take advantage of my interest in communication/organizational psychology
- use new technology to solve problems in previously-impossible ways
