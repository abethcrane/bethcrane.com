I bought my first DSLR at the start of 2012, and never looked back. You can find my favorite work on [flickr][flickr], or very occasional updates on [instagram][instagram].

## What I'm shooting these days ##
- I occasionally post new interviews with interesting folks in STEM fields to [Fibonacci Sequins][fibseq] - please reach out if you know someone who'd be fun to profile ðŸ˜„
- As I meet more and more musicians, I've started bringing my camera along to shows and spending hours in lightroom honing my color correction
- My oldest and truest love - travel photography
- Less polaroids these days, and more 35mm film
- Plants, always and forever, especially when they're drenched in sun
