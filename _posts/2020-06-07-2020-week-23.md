# I learned about... #
- Terraform! I used [this tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/azure/intro_az) for Azure
- [What to bring/not bring to a protest](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA0jzCdg_vR/)

# I worked on... #
- Remote Happy Hour! We realized that we were running into issues without a TURN server, so I used Terraform to deploy a linux VM on Azure, and provision it with CoTURN. Code [here](https://github.com/abethcrane/remote-happy-hour/tree/master/terraform)
- Generating and validating [837 files](https://therabill.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006846471-How-to-Read-an-EDI-837-File-Overview) at work
- Painting our newly built garden beds

# I was grateful for... #
- Having a supportive manager/team/workplace, where it was understood that the week was kind of a wash in terms of productivity.
