# I learned about... #
- The [Tulsa Race Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre). [@thedogwalkerblm](https://instagram.com/thedogwalkerblm) suggests a daily topic to learn about.

# I worked on... #
- Remote Happy Hour! I connected the TURN credentials through to the frontend via environment variables, and it just works!
- Moving some of my docs over from Dynalist to Notion, like [this list](https://www.notion.so/4f05e23cd87843d4a3d64858c65e31af?v=25c87e95e11c426b905462b3a75d65ce) of digital artists I love.

# I was grateful for... #
- Being able to get out from behind the screen with walking 1:1 phone calls to replace zoom meetings
- Having an e-bike to make wheeling around at golden hour extra magical
