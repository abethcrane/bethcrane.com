summary: Finding the longest palindrome in a word with a data structure called an 'eertree'. What's not to love?
---
It's a 3-day weekend here in the US of A, so what better way to spend it than learning about new and exciting data structures?

(Rhetorical question!)

A na√Øve way to find the longest palindromic substring of an input string is to start from every possible center-of-a-palindrome and work outwards, adding the next letter from each side until those letters aren't equal. The center could either be a letter, or it could be in between 2 letters - so for string of length *n* there will be *2n + 1* centers. This makes our na√Øve approach O(n^2). Not a terrible first stab, but we can do better.

Palindrome Trees do this in O(n) (technically quasilinear, but we dutifully ignore constants with big O notation). They're not the first algorithm to do so - [Manacher's Algorithm][manacher][^1] is from 1975 - but they're proposed as an improvement with smaller space usage.

What's neat about Palindrome Trees is that they're super new - the [paper][paper] just came out in 2015, and I could only find a handful of blogs about them (between [Geeks for Geeks post][blog1] and [Adilet's post][blog3] it was pretty easy to get up to speed, but I appreciated [Alessio's post][blog2] for pointing me to the academic paper[^2]). I saw a number of C/++ versions, and Alessio's Java solution, so I thought I'd try my hand at a python one, just for fun.

The code's up in [my first ever gist][gist], but this also seemed like a good excuse to add syntax highlighting to this website (via Rouge), so in celebration:

{% highlight python %}

class PalindromeTreeNode:
    # Important to note: we don't use start_index and end_index much
    # Because if this node is 'bb' and our string is 'abbacabbac' we'll see 'bb' twice
    # So we use the length to calculate where in the full string the start index would be
    # Each time we run across this node
    # The start and end indices are useful for printing out this node though
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    length = 0
    suffix_index = 0
    node_index = 0
    # Any palindrome can have up to 26 child palindromes
    # e.g. aPALINDROMEa, bPALINDROMEb, cPALINDROMEc, ..., zPALINDROMEz
    # So we store the node index, in the palindromic tree, where each one lives
    # (If it doesn't exist, its letter isnt in the dict)
