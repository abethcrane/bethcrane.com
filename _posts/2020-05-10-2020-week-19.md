# I learned about... #
- Flex. Here's a good tutorial: [a guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  - Notably: with flex-basis: 0, flex-grow will control the sizes of the children.
- Reading exif data from files. Here's the tool I used: [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)
- How to create a Ruby Gem (it's so easy!). Here's the tutorial I followed: [RubyGems guide](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)
- Foraging Fiddleheads from Ostrich Ferns!
  - Notably: ostrich ferns have grooves, brown chaff, and are smooth (not fuzzy). Pick them young (2-4" high, tightly curled fiddlehead). Boil or steam for 15 minutes and then sauté (never eat raw).

# I worked on... #
- A "Working with Beth" user manual! Here's the google doc: [Working with Beth: a User Manual ✨](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWxaT5hGTiT5XQLfSLMxA8RQs4tUf2ENzq2CtKYAk40/edit#)
- Displaying videos+images in the same gallery on this site. See: [the writeup]({% post_url 2020-05-10-aspect-ratios-and-image-galleries %}).
- Singing Wonderwall whilst playing the chords on guitar
  - I managed the first 2 lines!

# I was grateful for... #
- Sunlight streaming through leaves at golden hour (sounds pretentious but the embarrassing pictures of me crying about it are...less pretentious).
- My family's health
